 BUILDING TILED
----------------

NOTE: If you have downloaded the binary archive (bin), then you can skip this
as you will already have the tiled.jar file. Continue to "Running Tiled" below.

Take the following steps to build Tiled from source:

- Install j2sdk       (http://java.sun.com/)
- Install apache-ant  (http://ant.apache.org/)
- Run: 'ant dist' in the directory where you placed Tiled
  This will create a new subdirectory dist/

---------------
 RUNNING TILED
---------------

~ Getting the JVM ~

  Install JRE 1.4 or 5.0 from http://java.sun.com/ . Either will work, though 
  in the future we aim toward 5.0. If you already have the J2SDK, then you can
  safely skip this step.

~ Running ~
- From the command line, you can run the following from the directory where you
  placed Tiled:

  (*nix)    java -jar dist/tiled.jar
  
  (Windows) java -jar dist\tiled.jet
  
~ Notes ~

- You can also use the Java webstart link on the website, see "Start Now!"

- Windows users that have JRE 5.0 installed should be able to double click the
  tiled.jar file to run it.

- Make sure java binaries are in your path.
